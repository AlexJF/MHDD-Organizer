ABOUT

    MHDD Organizer aims to be an application which helps users manage
    their multimedia harddrives by parsing the entire directory tree
    and building a virtual database of all the movies in the disk,
    along with their TMDB (www.tmdb.org) or custom infos.

    This database may be cached locally so that changes and searches
    can be made without the HDD present and, when connected, those
    changes should sync with the information in the hard drive disk.


DEPENDENCIES
    
    MHDD Organizer is programmed in Python 2.7 and has the following
    dependencies:
      - wxPython
      - SQLite3 (python bindings)

USING (FROM SOURCE)
    To launch the application run:
    $ python main.py
    In the source's root directory

USING (FROM DIST BIN)
    To launch the application run:
    $ MHDDOrganizer
    In the dist bin directory

BUILDING DIST BIN
    To build a binary file containing the application in a contained
    environment, you must ensure that you can run the application
    correctly from source. 
    You need to install cx_Freeze and then run:
    $ python setup.py build
    
    This will create a build/exe.OS-PYTHONVERSION
