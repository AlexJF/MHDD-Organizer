ABOUT

    MHDD Organizer aims to be an application which helps users manage
    their multimedia harddrives by parsing the entire directory tree
    and building a virtual database of all the movies in the disk,
    along with their IMDB or custom infos.

    This database may be cached locally so that changes and searches
    can be made without the HDD present and, when connected, those
    changes should sync with the information in the hard drive disk.


USING
    
    MHDD Organizer is programmed in Python 2.7 and has the following
    dependencies:
      - wxPython
      - IMDbPY
      - SQLite3 (python bindings)

    To launch the application run:
    $ python main.py
    In the application's root directory
    (Atleast until I package it properly ;p)
