ABOUT

    MHDD Organizer aims to be an application which helps users manage
    their multimedia harddrives by parsing the entire directory tree
    and building a virtual database of all the movies in the disk,
    along with their IMDB or custom infos.

    It will also have the ability to save a teaser image with each
    movie containing important data like year, producer, main actors
    and such, so that you can check movie info right from your MHDD.


USING
    
    MHDD Organizer is programmed in Python, therefore no building is
    needed.

    It does, however, require the following dependencies to run:
      - Python 2.6
      - wxPython
